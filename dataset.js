        I can't lie, it feels nice that you're calling <br>
You sound sad and alone, and you're stalling <br>
And for once, I don't care about what you want <br>
As long as we keep talking (as long as we're talking) <br>
I mean, you gotta admit the history's kind of unmatched <br>
Asian Calvinism, we made it out of that <br>
Well, whether we're free of will or predestined <br>
Clearly, I've not learned my lesson even now <br>
Hope He doesn't strike me down (strike me down) <br>
The Goo Goo Dolls are dead to me <br>
The way you should be too <br>
But you bring them up <br>
Along with how much I fucking miss you <br>
Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried <br>
Maybe life's less romantic when I don't wanna die <br>
You'd think I'd be a fast learner <br>
But guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner <br>
Backburner <br>
Your backburner <br>
Your backburner <br>
Your backburner <br>
It's pathetic, but at least you are, too <br>
I don't know what to do <br>
I don't like anyone except sometimes you <br>
And now you're sounding like a hurt puppy <br>
You look ugly when you cry <br>
But I'm the one you think to call <br>
How do you feel lucky and appalled at the same time? <br>
After everything you put me through <br>
I somehow still believe in you, oh-oh <br>
But I know in a week or so <br>
You'll fade away again <br>
And I wish that I cared <br>
Hey, are you still there? <br>
Good <br>
Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried <br>
'Cause maybe you'll finally choose me after you've had more time <br>
I thought I was a fast learner <br>
But guess I won't ever mind, guess I won't ever mind <br>
Maybe I blame my mother bleeding into my stride <br>
Maybe it was my father and his wandering eyes <br>
(It's their fault that) <br>
I'll always be in your corner <br>
'Cause I don't feel alive 'til I'm burnin' on your backburner, oh-oh <br>
(Backburner, your backburner) <br>
And I know that it's sad that I settle for the backburner, oh-oh (your backburner) <br>
(Your backburner, your backburner) <br>
Guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner, oh-oh (your backburner) <br>
(Backburner, your backburner) <br>
As long as you still think of me, oh, oh-oh (backburner, backburner) <br>

Usia anak SMA <br>
Di sekolah kita berjumpa <br>
Pulang pasti kita berdua <br>

Jumpa <br>

Aku suka selalu denganmu <br>

        My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why <br>
I got out of bed at all <br>
The morning rain clouds up my window <br>
And I can't see at all <br>
And even if I could, it'd all be gray <br>
But your picture on my wall <br>
It reminds me that it's not so bad <br>
It's not so bad <br>
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay <br>
My head just feels in pain <br>
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today <br>
I'm late for work again <br>
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply <br>
That I might not last the day <br>
And then you call me <br>
And it's not so bad, it's not so bad <br>
And I want to thank you <br>
For giving me the best day of my life <br>
Oh, just to be with you <br>
Is having the best day of my life <br>
Push the door, I'm home at last <br>
And I'm soaking through and through <br>
Then you handed me a towel <br>
And all I see is you <br>
And even if my house falls down now <br>
I wouldn't have a clue <br>
Because you're near me <br>
And I want to thank you <br>
For giving me the best day of my life <br>
Oh, just to be with you <br>
Is having the best day of my life <br>
And I want to thank you <br>
For giving me the best day of my life <br>

        It's a human sign <br>
When things go wrong <br>
When the scent of her lingers <br>
And temptation's strong <br>
Into the boundary <br>
Of each married man <br>
Sweet deceit comes calling <br>
And negativity lands <br>
Cold cold heart <br>
Hard done by you <br>
Some things look better, baby <br>
Just passing through <br>
And it's no sacrifice <br>
Just a simple word <br>
It's two hearts living <br>
In two separate worlds <br>
But it's no sacrifice <br>
No sacrifice <br>
It's no sacrifice at all <br>
Mutual misunderstanding <br>
After the fact <br>
Sensitivity builds a prison <br>
In the final act <br>
We lose direction <br>
No stone unturned <br>
No tears to damn you <br>
When jealousy burns <br>
Cold, cold heart <br>
Hard done by you <br>
Some things look better, baby <br>
Just passin' through <br>
And it's no sacrifice <br>
Just a simple word <br>
It's two hearts livin' <br>
In two separate worlds <br>
But, it's no sacrifice <br>
No sacrifice <br>
It's no sacrifice, at all <br>
Cold, cold heart <br>
Hard done by you <br>
Some things look better, baby <br>

No sacrifice <br>
It's no sacrifice, at all <br>
No sacrifice, at all <br>
No sacrifice, at all <br>
No sacrifice, at all <br>
No sacrifice, at all <br>
